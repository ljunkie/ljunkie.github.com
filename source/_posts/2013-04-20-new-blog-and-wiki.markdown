Just a quick not. I finally gave up on [wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and switched to [octopress](http://ocotopress.org). I wanted something **_simple_** and **_clean_**. There are so many other reasons, but it's the weekend and I don't feel like _working_.

I also rolled out a [wiki](//w.rarforge.com) recently which I started to use a month ago. It will probably have more detailed information about the posts here.
